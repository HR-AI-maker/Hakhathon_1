========================================
YOUR VERCEL URL INSTRUCTIONS
========================================

I just opened the Vercel Dashboard in your browser.

FOLLOW THESE STEPS:

1. Look at the browser that just opened
2. You'll see your project listed (probably named "claude" or similar)
3. The URL is shown right there - it looks like:

   https://something-something.vercel.app

4. COPY that URL
5. PASTE it in the chat with Claude

========================================
THAT'S IT!
========================================

Example of what to paste:
https://claude-abc123.vercel.app

Just copy the URL from the browser and paste it!
